# SBSPS-Challenge-1045-Predicting-the-energy-output-of-wind-turbine-based-on-weather-condition
## DESCRIPTION
Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction.
In this project, wind power forecasting for the next 72 hours is done using LSTM. The ipynb file attached contains the code.The dataset used is taken from the NERL website which is also attached for reference.The dataset contains wind power production energy for five years.
